	<p class="quote">Alexander the Great was a successful ruler because his actions created long lasting effects on cultures that continue to the present day. One example of his legacy was the creation of a Hellenistic society. Hellenism was the combination of Greek, Persian, and Egyptian cultures.</p>

	<p>During this remarkable time period, people were encouraged to pursue a formal education and produce many different kinds of art. New forms of math,
	science, and design made a great impact on society. If this new way of life had not been as successful as it was, Alexander’s legacy would not be as memorable and groundbreaking. Because he conquered many countries and blended together many different cultures, Alexander the Great is widely recognized for his achievements and credited with being one of the greatest rulers in history.</p>

	<p class="quote">To understand the answer to the question of whether the mobile phone signal jammer affects the Internet access of the notebook computer, you must first understand the interference frequency band of the mobile phone signal jammer and the frequency band used by the notebook computer to surf the Internet.</p>
	<p>First of all, if the interference frequency band of the mobile phone signal jammer overlaps the frequency band used by the notebook computer to surf the Internet, it will affect the Internet function of the notebook computer. Let’s first look at the interference frequency band of the mobile phone signal jammer. Because domestic operators have wide signal coverage and multiple formats, mobile phone signal jammers must achieve the effect of shielding the entire network. Generally, they will effectively shield interference from 2G, 3G, 4G frequency band signals, WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth signals.</p>
